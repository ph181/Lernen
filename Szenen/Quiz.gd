Sure! I can help you create a simple GDScript AI quiz that can help identify potential problems. Here's an example of how you can implement it:

	Create a new GDScript file in your game project and name it something like "ProblemQuiz.gd".
	Open the file and define a new class called "ProblemQuiz" that extends the Node class:



extends Node

# Add your problem questions and corresponding answers
var questions = [
	"Do you often feel stressed?": "stress",
	"Are you experiencing difficulty sleeping?": "insomnia",
	"Do you feel constantly tired or fatigued?": "fatigue",
	# Add more questions here
]

# Keep track of the user's answers
var userAnswers = {}

# Function to start the quiz
func startQuiz():
	print("Welcome to the Problem Quiz!")
	print("Answer each question with 'yes' or 'no'.")
	print("Let's begin...\n")
	askQuestion(0)

# Recursive function to ask questions
func askQuestion(index):
	if index >= questions.size():
		endQuiz()
		return

	var question = questions.keys()[index]
	var answerKey = questions[question]

	print(question)

	# Wait for user input
	var userInput = yield(Engine.wait_for_input)

	# Validate user input
	if userInput == "yes" or userInput == "no":
		userAnswers[answerKey] = userInput
		askQuestion(index + 1)
	else:
		print("Invalid input! Please answer with 'yes' or 'no'.")
		askQuestion(index)

# Function to end the quiz and display results
func endQuiz():
	print("\nThank you for completing the quiz!")
	print("Here are your results:\n")

	# Analyze user's answers
	var problems = []
	for problem in userAnswers.keys():
		if userAnswers[problem] == "yes":
			problems.append(problem)

	# Display the identified problems
	if problems.size() > 0:
		print("Based on your answers, it seems you may be experiencing the following problems:")
		for problem in problems:
			print("- " + problem)
	else:
		print("Based on your answers, it seems you're not currently experiencing any problems.")

	# Clear user's answers for a fresh start
	userAnswers.clear()
}
	Now, you can create an instance of the ProblemQuiz class and call the startQuiz() function whenever you want to initiate the quiz:

gdscript

# Create an instance of ProblemQuiz
var problemQuiz = ProblemQuiz.new()

# Start the quiz
problemQuiz.startQuiz()

That's it! When you run your game and execute the code above, the quiz will start and ask the questions one by one. The user's responses will be recorded, and at the end, the quiz will analyze the answers and display any potential problems based on the user's responses.

Feel free to customize the questions and add more as needed. You can also modify the output and the behavior of the quiz to suit your specific requirements.
